# IT102.Card.Object
First excersize with Objects
In order to model card games better, we need to have the code equivalent of a deck of cards. As a starting point towards this deck of cards, we should begin with a good card object. Your assignment today is to create and test a card object. Here some things your card object should have:

Properties

Suit
Rank
isVisible
Methods

show()
hide()
Suit should include Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, and Spades. Rank should include Ace through King. (Joker is not required). 

For testing purposes, create a Card constructor. Then instantiate at least 2 different cards. (You can call them card1 and card2, or something like that.) Create output statements that show the suit, rank, and visibility of each test card. Then demonstrate that after using show() and hide() on one of the cards its visibility changes.
